Vaidehi works at Momentum, a company that makes particle accelerators. One way to increase the momentum at collision is to increase the mass of the particle, so Vaidehi is trying to train elephants to slowly walk into one another. If she succeeds, she'll cause a collision with over 10^20 times more momentum than the worlds fastest accelerator. Unfortunately, the elephants are too polite, and simply wait for the other to pass.
